* [Import attributes](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-attributes) are now supported.
  Note that import attributes are an evolution of an earlier proposal called "import assertions", which were implemented in TypeScript 4.5.
  The QL library includes new predicates named `getImportAttributes()` that should be used in favor of the now deprecated `getImportAssertion()`.
